### Welcome to the Brain Games
Brain Games includes five math games: 'Parity Check', 'Calculator', 'Greatest Common Divisor', 'Arithmetic Progression' and 'Is it a Simple Number?'. <br />
All games are started and played using the terminal. <br />


### Requirements
- [python](https://www.python.org/), version 3.9 or higher
- [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), version 1.0.0 or higher
- [prompt](https://prompt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package, version 0.4.1 or higher


### Installation
Clone this repo or download it with pip:
```ch

```
```ch
pip install --user git+https://github.com/zluuba/brain-games.git
```

Use these commands to install package:
```ch
make install

make package-install
```

### Commands

#### **"Parity Check"** game
Is a number on the screen, you must enter "yes" if the number is even and "no" if it's not. <br />
[Demonstration](https://github.com/zluuba/python-project-49#even-game)
```ch
brain-even
```

#### **"Calculator"** game
Is given a mathematical expression, you need to calculate it and enter the result. <br />
[Demonstration](https://github.com/zluuba/python-project-49#calculator-game-1)
```ch
brain-calc
```

#### **"The Greatest Common Divisor"** game
Two numbers are given, you need find the greatest common divisor and enter the result [(about GSD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) <br />
[Demonstration](https://github.com/zluuba/python-project-49#greatestcommondivisor-game)
```ch
brain-gcd
```

#### **"Arithmetic Progression"** game
Is given an arithmetic sequence in which one number is hidden, you must enter the missing number. <br />
[Demonstration](https://github.com/zluuba/python-project-49#progression-game)
```ch
brain-progression
```

#### **"Is it a Simple Number?"** game
Is a number on the screen, you must enter "yes" if the number is prime and "no" if it's not [(about prime numbers)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) <br />
[Demonstration](https://github.com/zluuba/python-project-49#prime-game)
```ch
brain-prime
```
