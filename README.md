### Welcome
This is my first project on Python. <br />
It includes five math games: "Parity Check", "Calculator", "Greatest Common Divisor", "Arithmetic Progression" and "Is it a Simple Number?". <br />
All games are started and played using the terminal.

### Requirements
- python, version 3.10 or higher (https://www.python.org/)
- poetry, version 1.0.0 or higher (https://python-poetry.org/)
- prompt package, version 0.4.1 or higher (https://prompt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)


### How to install and play
Download full package and run the command: "make package-install". <br />
Now all games are available on these five commands:
1. "brain-even" - running the Parity Check game. Is a number on the screen, you must enter "yes" if the number is even and "no" if it's not.
2. "brain-calc" - Calculator game. Is given a mathematical expression, you need to calculate it and enter the result.
3. "brain-gcd" - The Greatest Common Divisor game. Two numbers are given, you need to calculate the greatest common divisor and enter the result. More about GSD: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor
4. "brain-progression" - Arithmetic Progression game. Is given an arithmetic sequence in which one number is hidden, you must enter the missing number.
5. "brain-prime" - Is it a Simple Number? game. Is a number on the screen, you must enter "yes" if the number is prime and "no" if it's not. More about prime numbers: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number
